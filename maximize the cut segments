Given an integer N denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.



def maximizeTheCuts(self,n,x,y,z):
    #dp[i] == it points to maximum cuts of the ith lenght log
    dp = [-1]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 0 
    if n < 0:
        dp[n] = float('-inf')
    if dp[n] != -1:
        return dp[n]
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i >= x and dp[i - x] != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i],1 + dp[i-x])
        if i >= y and dp[i - y] != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i],1 + dp[i-y]) 
        if i >= z and dp[i - z] != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i],1 + dp[i-z])

    return dp[n] if dp[n] != -1 else 0
