Given a floor of size n x m and tiles of size 1 x m. The problem is to count the number of ways to tile the given floor using 1 x m tiles.
A tile can either be placed horizontally or vertically.
Both n and m are positive integers and 2 < = m.
 
Example 1 :

Input: n = 2, m = 3
Output: 1
Expanation: There is only one way to tile the
given floor.


class Solution:
	def countWays(self, n, m):
	    if m > n:
	        return 1
	    if n == m:
	        return 2
	    dp = [0]*(n+1)
	    for i in range(1,n+1):
	        if i < m:
	            dp[i] = 1
	        elif i == m:
	            dp[i] = 2
	        else:
	            #algorithm
	            dp[i] = dp[i-m] + dp[i-1]
	    return dp[n]%1000000007
