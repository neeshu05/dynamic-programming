There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top.
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, 
the person can reach the top (order does matter).


Input:
n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
You can reach 4th stair in 5 ways. 
Way 1: Climb 2 stairs at a time. 
Way 2: Climb 1 stair at a time.
Way 3: Climb 2 stairs, then 1 stair
and then 1 stair.
Way 4: Climb 1 stair, then 2 stairs
then 1 stair.
Way 5: Climb 1 stair, then 1 stair and
then 2 stairs.


def countWays(self,n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]%1000000007
